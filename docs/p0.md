## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

```
ljmp  $0x3630,$0xf000e05b
```

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

`0xffff0`. This address is located in the BIOS ROM region. Early BIOS executes directly from the flash chip. Later, for second and third stage bootloaders, BIOS will copy itself into processor cache and finally RAM.


#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

By invoking BIOS interrupt 13.

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

In the function `read_mbr`, the bootloader calls `read_sector`, which in turn invokes the BIOS interrupt 13. If `read_sector` fails, it returns with the carry flag set, indicating an error. In case of an error, `read_mbr` jumps to `no_such_drive`. It then checks for the MBR signature, and subsequently verifies that the partition is being used, bootable, and contains the Pintos kernel (three conditions in total).

**What is `Print hd[a-z]`?** The code checks whether the disk has an MBR signature, which is a boot sector signature indicating that the disk is partitioned. If the signature is present, the code prints the message "hd[a-z]" to indicate that a hard disk was found, and sets al to the ASCII code of the character '1' to indicate the partition number.

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

It will call `next_partition` until it finds the kernel or reach the end of the partition table. In the end, if the kernel is not found, it will output `"\rNot found\r"` and notify BIOS that boot failed.

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

After the bootloader has found the kernel, it starts loading the kernel. The maximum size of a kernel is 512KB. We transder the control to the kernel after we have loaded the kernel. As the bootloader runs in the legacy real mode, we need to  convert the 32-bit linear address specified in the ELF header of the kernel into a 16:16 segment:offset. Then we jump to the converted address.

#### QUESTIONS: KERNEL

>B7: At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression `init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))]` in hexadecimal format?

0x0

>B8: When `palloc_get_page()` is called for the first time,

>> B8.1 what does the call stack look like?

## Kernel Monitor

>C1: Put the screenshot of your kernel monitor running example here. (It should show how your kernel shell respond to `whoami`, `exit`, and `other input`.)

>C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.

In a infinite loop, `input_getc()` is called to get the input char which will be concated into a string named command. We compare the command with "whoami" and "exit".
